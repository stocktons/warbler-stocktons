# Warbler

Warbler is a Twitter clone where users can like and unlike each other's warbles, follow and unfollow each other, and see a feed of other users.
This was a stub application with bugs and incomplete routes that we worked to fix as a project at Rithm. My coding partner for the project 
was [Loni Kuang](https://github.com/lawnknee), but I added additional features and fixed further bugs on this version by myself after the 
timespan of the in-class project was complete.

## Live Demo

Here is a [live demo](https://warbler-stocktons.herokuapp.com) of the Warbler app. Use 'tuckerdiane' and 'password' to log in for the best experience, 
with the ability to see a profile pre-loaded with followers, warbles, and likes. However, also feel free to sign up and create a new profile from scratch!
